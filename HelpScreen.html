	<h4>Welcome to the Neighborhood Map Project</h4>
	<p>
	Welcome to downtown Greensboro, <a></a>North Carolina. In the years I've been here, our downtown has opened new establishments, seen run-down buildings rejuvenated and reused, and sprouted new parks and museums.
	</p><p>
	This web page is my chance to share some of my favorite spots downtown and to let you discover some other spots that appeal to you. When you first run the page I show you a set of places I've picked for you. There are some of my favorite spots (if they're old enough for complete entries in Yelp and Google Maps). I've also included a few places that most residents would know.
	</p><p>
	You will see a map of downtown at the left of your display or (on a mobile device) at the top. The places are marked with colored icons, one color for each category. To the right of (or below) the map, you'll see a list of the places and their addresses. If you click on either the list entry or the map marker, it selects that place and "turns on" an icon that takes you to detailed information about the place (furnished by Google Maps and Yelp). Interested? You can click through to reviews, pictures, and more information from the two data sources. Or you can visit the place's own website. Too many places at once? Click on "Filter" and choose one category at a time to explore.
	</p><p>
	If you aren't all that interested in one of my places, you can unpin it (there's a button in the list item or at the bottom of the details window). If you want to look for more places, click on the "Find new" button at the top of the list. A box will appear on the map, and you can type in search items and see what Google has in store. If you find places you want to "collect," just pin them and they will become a permanent part of your personal collection. To return to your personal collection, click on the "Pinned only" button and your collection will reappear.
	</p><p>
	When you close the page, the places you have pinned will be stored on your computer. The next time you come back, your set of places will be displayed, and you can continue your virtual exploration. Enjoy!
