	<h4>Welcome to the Neighborhood Map Project</h4>
	<p>
	Welcome to downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. In the years I’ve been here, our downtown has opened new establishments, seen run-down buildings rejuvenated and reused, and sprouted new parks and museums.
	</p><p>
	This web page is my chance to share some of my favorite spots downtown and to let you discover other spots that appeal to you. When you first run the page I show you a set of places I’ve picked out. Some are my favorite spots (the ones old enough to get  entries in Yelp and Google Maps). I’ve also included a few places that most residents would know.
	</p><p>
	You will see a map of downtown in the main part of your display. My places are marked with colored icons, one color for each category. There is also a list of the places and their addresses. On larger displays, the list is displayed on the left 1/3 of the screen. On smaller (mobile) devices, you see the list by clicking on the gray "list" icon in the upper left corner of the display. Every place that's displayed has an entry in the list view and a marker on the map.
	</p><p>
	If you click on either the list entry or the map marker, it selects that place and drops down a *Place Detail* screen, showing more about the place (data from Google Maps and Yelp). Interested? You can click through to reviews, pictures, and more information from the two data sources. Or you can visit the place's own website. Too many places at once? Click on “Filter” at the top of the list view and choose one category at a time to explore.
	</p><p>
	If you aren’t all that interested in one of my places, you can unpin it (there’s a button at the right the list item or at the bottom of the Detail Window). If you want to look for more places, click on the “Find new” button at the top of the list. A box will appear on the map, and you can type in search items and see what Google has in store. If you find places you want to “collect,” just pin them and they will become a permanent part of your personal collection. To return to your personal collection, click on the “Pinned only” button and your collection will reappear.
	</p><p>
	When you close the page, the places you have pinned will be stored on your computer. The next time you come back, your set of places will be displayed, and you can continue your virtual exploration. Enjoy!
